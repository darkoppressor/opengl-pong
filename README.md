Pong using OpenGL!
http://cheeseandbacon.org/

Yet another simple pong clone. This one is actually simpler than the other two. It uses OpenGL for graphics.
Noticing the relatively slow framerates inherent in software rendering, I determined to learn how to use OpenGL to access hardware rendering.
OpenGL Pong is the product of this learning project.
